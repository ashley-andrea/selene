## Candidate Pills (survived safety gate)
Each pill entry includes:
- Brand/generic name
- Type: "combined (estrogen+progestin)" or "progestin-only"
- Active substances (substance_name)
- Excerpts from FDA labeling: boxed_warning, contraindications, warnings

{candidate_pills_detail}

## Your Task

For EACH candidate pill, calculate a **risk score** from 0.0 (safest) to 1.0 (riskiest) for THIS specific patient.

Consider:
- **Pill type**: Combined (estrogen+progestin) pills carry higher VTE risk, especially for smokers, patients with hypertension, migraines, or cardiovascular history. Progestin-only pills are generally safer for high-risk patients.
- **Active substances**: Infer risk from the substance_name (e.g., drospirenone has anti-androgenic properties; levonorgestrel is older generation with known VTE profile; desogestrel/gestodene are 3rd-gen with higher VTE risk)
- **FDA labeling text**: Use boxed_warning, contraindications, and warnings excerpts to identify patient-specific red flags
- **Patient habits**: Smoking significantly increases cardiovascular and VTE risk with combined pills
- **Medical history**: DVT/PE history is a major risk factor with combined pills
- **The relative risk rules from medical guidelines**

}}

**Rules**:
- Assess ALL candidate pills
- Select 3-8 pills for simulation, prioritizing those with LOW risk scores
- Progestin-only pills should generally score LOWER (safer) for patients with cardiovascular or VTE risk factors
- For a healthy young patient with no risk factors, combined pills are acceptable — you can send more to simulation
- For high-risk patients (smokers, VTE history, hypertension), strongly prefer progestin-only
- risk_score must reflect the pill's risk FOR THIS SPECIFIC PATIENT — do NOT assign the same score to all pills
- pills_to_simulate should be ordered from lowest to highest risk
- Differentiate scores meaningfully: a progestin-only pill for a smoker should score ~0.2, a combined pill ~0.6+
